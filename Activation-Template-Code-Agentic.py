    3. If the order is not activated, retrieve the line information for the order.

    2. **Check Activation Status**: This tool is used to check the activation status of an order.

    3. **Retrieve Line Information**: This tool fetches line-level information for the customer account.

    4. **Submit Activation**: This tool triggers the activation process for an order.

    Provide detailed instructions to ensure each of these steps is completed correctly.
